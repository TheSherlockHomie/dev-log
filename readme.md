### August 14, 2020, Friday

**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Educational Codeforces Round 93 (Div 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1398). Was able to solve only one question :(

**Thoughts:**

-   Taking it a bit slow after the completion of my #100DaysOfCode.
-   Still think that I _could_ have solved atleast one more question if I had thought hard enough.

### August 22, 2020, Saturday

**Progress:**

-   Learned about some standard dynamic programming concepts.

**Thoughts:**

-   Currently quite busy teaching a workshop, yet do need to find more time for programming.

### August 23, 2020, Sunday

**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Google Kickstart Round E](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000019ff47)
-   Solved the first question.
-   Almost solved the second question. However, in competitive programming, _almost_ doesn't count.

**What I learned:**

-   Constructive Algorithms
-   How to approach constructive algorithm questions.

**Thoughts:**

-   It was an okay round.

### August 24, 2020, Monday

**Progress:**

-   Revised Graphs (and taught him some concepts) with Trexxx27

**What I learned:**

-   Apart from revision, learned applications of graph traversal
-   Checking if bipartite using DFS
-   Finding shortest path between two nodes in unweighted graph using BFS
-   Checking connectivity
-   Finding cycles

### August 25, 2020, Tuesday

**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Educational Codeforces Round 94 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1400).
-   Was able to solve only one question during the contest, however, as soon as it was over(ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), solved another question by myself!

**What I learned:**

-   You can run a greedy solution iteratively changing the starting variable between runs and find the best answer among them. (I get that this sounds confusing)

**Thoughts:**

-   Great to have friends who participate in contests with you. It is pretty great to be able to discuss the solutions afterward. [(TREXXX27)](https://github.com/TREXXX27)
