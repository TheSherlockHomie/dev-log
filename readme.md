**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Educational Codeforces Round 93 (Div 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1398). Was able to solve only one question :(

**Thoughts:**

-   Taking it a bit slow after the completion of my #100DaysOfCode.
-   Still think that I _could_ have solved atleast one more question if I had thought hard enough.

-   Learned about some standard dynamic programming concepts.
