### August 14, 2020, Friday

**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Educational Codeforces Round 93 (Div 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/1398). Was able to solve only one question :(

**Thoughts:**

-   Taking it a bit slow after the completion of my #100DaysOfCode.
-   Still think that I _could_ have solved atleast one more question if I had thought hard enough.

**Progress:**

-   Learned about some standard dynamic programming concepts.

**Thoughts:**

-   Currently quite busy teaching a workshop, yet do need to find more time for programming.

**Progress:**

-   Participated in [Google Kickstart Round E](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000019ff47)
-   Solved the first question.
-   Almost solved the second question. However, in competitive programming, _almost_ doesn't count.

**What I learned:**

-   Constructive Algorithms
-   How to approach constructive algorithm questions.

**Thoughts:**

-   It was an okay round.

-   Checking connectivity
-   Finding cycles
